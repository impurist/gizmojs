gizmo.js

Pure javascript port of the Gizmo (Ruby) page model framework (http://gizmo-gem.info/).

The intention here is to provide dynamic Screen models for testing iOS apps with the UIAutomation framework provided by Apple.

I am using node.js here to make it easy to test drive with Jasmine. 


dependencies:

node.js (for running specs)
underscore.js (specs and usage)
